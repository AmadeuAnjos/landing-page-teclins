## Idea
The idea came from a need. To create a landing page for a friend, so that clients could find him on Google and show their services and products.

## Development
After developing the graphical interface in Figma, I started to turn it into code. My second project in Figma, I'm liking it a lot, although new ideas come up during the development the code is very intuitive.
